## Step 1 - Synthetic Data Pre-Processing

### Question 2
_How did you generate your synthetic dataset? Please provide a detailed description of the code you wrote to generate your synthetic dataset._ 

_Include examples of images from the synthetic data you constructed and basic statistical information on your synthetic dataset._

## Step 2 - Minimum Viable Architecture

### Question 3

_Prepare a brief analysis of this minimal example neural network. What is its architecture? How is the model trained? What are your thoughts on its performance?_

_Prepare a plot of model performance during training._

## Step 3 - Design and Test a Model Architecture

### Question 4
_Describe your process for getting your initial pipeline working. What approach did you take bringing your deep learning system online? Please provide any references or personal experiments._

_Provide a detailed description of your initial architecture._

_Present a graphic visualizing your initial architecture._

### Question 5
_What does your iterated architecture look like (Type of model, layers, sizes, connectivity, etc.)?_

_Describe the process by which you created newer and better network architectures._

_Provide a detailed description of your iterated architecture._

_How is your iterated model different from your initial model?_

_Please provide any references or personal experiments._

_Present a graphic visualizing your final architecture._

### Question 6

_How did you train your model?_

_Which loss function did you use? What does this function do?_

_Which optimizer did you use? What does this do?_

_How many epochs did you train? What was your batch size?_ 

_Did you define any other parameters for your model?_

_Describe how all of these impact the training of your model._

### Question 7

_Prepare a plot of model performance during training._

_Provide an analysis of your plot and how it was used to drive innovation on your network._


## Step 4 - SVHN Pre-Processing

### Question 8

_Provide some description of what this dataset is, how it was originally generated, and from where it can be obtained._

_Describe how you set up the training and testing data for your model._ 

_Display samples from the SVHN dataset._

## Step 5 - Train a Model on a Realistic Dataset

### Question 9

_How does the model perform on a realistic dataset?_ 

_How does the model's performanc compare to the performance of the same model on the synthetic dataset?_

_Prepare a plot of performance as the model is trained against the SVHN. What does this show? How does it compare to the training against the synthetic dataset?_

**Note:** it is not critical to success on this project that your model perform "well". What is critical is that you discuss your performance and **why** you believe your model performed in the way that it did.

### Question 10

_What changes did you have to make, if any, to achieve "good" results?_

_Were there any options you explored that made the results worse?_

**Note:** if you have not made any refinements to your initial model, you must provide a detailed justification for not making these refinements.

### Question 11

_What were your initial and final results with testing on a realistic dataset? Do you believe your model is doing a good enough job at classifying numbers correctly?_

## Step 6 - Capture and Pre-process a New Set of Images

### Question 12
_Choose five candidate images of numbers you took from around you and provide them in the report. Are there any particular qualities of the image(s) that might make classification difficult?_

_Display your captured images._

## Step 7 - Test a Model on Newly Captured Images

### Question 13
_Is your model able to perform equally well on captured pictures when compared to testing on the realistic dataset?_

## Conclusion

### Question 14

_Please provide some visualization of the work that you did to complete this project. This visualization is intentionally left up to you and you are encouraged to be creative with what you show as a summary visualization to the work that you have done._

_Provide a disucssion of your summary visualization._

### Question 15

_Please provide a high-level summary of the work that you have done to complete this task and its significance to the domain of deep learning._
